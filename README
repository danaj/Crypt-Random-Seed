Crypt::Random::Seed version 0.01
========================

Crypt::Random::Seed provides a simple interface to get the strongest source
of randomness on the current platform.  This may take a very long time.  This
is intended to provide a seed for a good random number generator, such as
Math::Random::ISAAC, or for use when generating cryptographic keys.

For non-blocking source, I recommend Crypt::URandom.

For more complex setups, Crypt::Random::Source has multiple plugins.

The following sources are tried, in order:
  Win32 Crypto API
  /dev/random
  Crypt::Random::TESHA2


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

Win32::API on Windows, FileHandle on non-Windows

Crypt::Random::TESHA2, only used if /dev/random or Win32 API doesn't work.
