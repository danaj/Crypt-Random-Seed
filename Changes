Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Random::Seed

0.02  21 Jan 2013

  - Add EGD/PRNGD source.

  - More documentation.

  - More strict with perlcritic (used Bytes::Random::Secure for some reference)

  - Remove 'Weak' constructor option.  There was too little logic behind what
    got called strong or weak.  The is_strong() call is still left, so the
    caller can use it possibly in conjunction with the name() value to make a
    more informed decision.

  - Initial development
